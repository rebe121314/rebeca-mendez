#Rebeca's whimsical Bio :)

![Welcome](https://media.giphy.com/media/XD9o33QG9BoMis7iM4/giphy.gif)

I'm creating **this** bio for 3 reasons:

1. PCW
2. Figure out Github once and for all (it's been on my to do list, for a whileeeeeeee)
3. Seems fun!
   * Honestly, I don't have anything else to right here
   * I'm just testing it out

*How am I?*


Starting from the basics it's easist:

* My full name is Rebeca Maria Mendez Planchart
* I was born on May 12th 2001
* I'm from Venezuela
* I'm part of M24


> "Not knowing anything is the sweetest life"
> *Sophocles *

Welp, that quotes applies to me. I used to thing I knew myself, but it's not surprised to anyone else,but to me in the past, that in fact I know nothing.


##??

Soo, for the sake of accuracy (or at least minimizing the cringines in the future when I see this agin) I'll stop here. But I'll leave one of my favorite "*excistencial*"/*identity* videos.
